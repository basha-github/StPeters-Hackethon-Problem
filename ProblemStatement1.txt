Explanation
There are two colonies in the city.

The first colony has  8 buildings and the earning of Rahul for communicating with each building is 20 rupees.

Height of buildings are  6 1 2 15 3 10 50 29 respectively.

As Chef is standing at point 0, he will be able to see only 1st,4th and 7th building.

So his total earning will be  in that road 20 * 3 = 60
